                      <em>The higher your ACE score, the higher your risk of health and social problems.</em><br>

                          As your ACE score increases, so does the risk of disease, social and emotional problems.<br>
                          An ACE score of just 1 sufficiently traumatizes us so that we are twice as likely to become an alcoholic.<br>

                          <em>With an ACE score of 4 or more, things start getting serious. The likelihood of chronic pulmonary lung disease increases 390 percent; hepatitis, 240 percent; depression 460 percent; suicide, 1,220 percent.</em><br>

                          The most important thing to remember is that the ACE score is meant as a guideline: If you experienced other types of toxic stress over months or years, then those would likely increase your risk of health consequences as well.<br>
                          Fortunately, our brains and lives are somewhat plastic, which means our mental and physical health can improve. The appropriate integration of resilience factors born out of ACE concepts — such as asking for help, developing trusting relationships, forming a positive attitude, listening to feelings — can help people improve their lives.<br>
